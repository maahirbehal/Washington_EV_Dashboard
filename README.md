# 📊 Washington EV Adoption Dashboard | Tableau Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Washington EV Adoption Dashboard** built using Tableau, focused on transforming electric vehicle population data into structured, decision ready business insights.

The objective was not only to visualise data, but to explore adoption trends across manufacturers, vehicle types and geographic regions while designing a dashboard that supports data driven decision making and clear business reporting.

## 🎯 Business Questions Explored
• Which manufacturers lead electric vehicle adoption across Washington State  
• How has EV adoption evolved over time  
• Which counties show the highest concentration of electric vehicles  
• How do Battery Electric Vehicles compare with Plug in Hybrid vehicles  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
• EV ownership is concentrated within a small number of Washington counties  
• Tesla dominates overall adoption, highlighting strong manufacturer influence  
• Adoption growth accelerated significantly after 2020  
• Battery Electric Vehicles represent the majority share compared to plug in hybrids

## 📊 Business Impact Perspective
While this project focuses on Washington State EV data, the analytical approach reflects real world business reporting scenarios.

Understanding regional adoption patterns can support strategic decisions such as market expansion planning, infrastructure investment prioritisation and manufacturer performance tracking. By identifying trends across vehicle types, geographic regions and time, dashboards like this can help stakeholders move from raw data to structured insight generation.

The emphasis throughout this project was on clarity, usability and decision focused reporting rather than simply presenting charts. Features such as parameter driven filtering, make and model hierarchies and consistent dashboard level interactions were designed to simulate how business users explore data to answer evolving questions.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project represents part of my ongoing analytics journey focused on building dashboards that combine technical data visualisation skills with business oriented thinking. My goal is to design solutions that bring structure to data, clarity to decisions and meaningful business insights for stakeholders.

I continue to develop projects aligned with Business Analytics, Data Analytics and data driven decision making, with a strong focus on practical problem solving and clear communication through data.
